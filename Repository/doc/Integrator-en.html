  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>When piloting a glider it is essential to know not only the current climb rate, but also the average over a certain duration.<br>
     The app features two basic modes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>vario integrated:</b> Actually integrates a variometer sensor value. The average then equals the integral divided by the interval duration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>altitude difference:</b> Reads the altitude once before each announcement. The average is calculated as the difference of the current altitude relative to the last value, divided by the interval duration.
      </li>
    </ul
  </p>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Select a variometer or an altitude sensor as the input.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Define a switch to turn the speech output on and off. When no switch is selected the output is always active.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Set the interall (in seconds) at which the average climb rate is calculated and announced.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
