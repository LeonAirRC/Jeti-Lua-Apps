<h3>Switches</h3>
<p>The switches used to go to the next/previous state.</p>

<h3>Control</h3>
<p>Select one out of the ten virtual controls as the output.</p>

<h3>Delay</h3>
<p>Set the control's delay in ms.</p>

<h3>Smooth</h3>
<p>Uses a lowpass filtering algorithm instead of linear interpolation when checked.</p>

<h3>Endless</h3>
<p>When checked, the state can jump to the other end of the sequence. This applies to both directions.</p>

<h3>States</h3>
<p>The list of states. The deflection for each state can be set.<br/>
The current state is displayed in bold font.<br/>
The initial state (on application initialization) can be selected with the button <b>F(3)</b> and is indicated by the <b>(init)</b> phrase.<br/>
The number of states has to be between 1 and 20.</p>
