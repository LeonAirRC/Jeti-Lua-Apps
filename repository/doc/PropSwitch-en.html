  <h1>Proportional Switch</h1>
  <p>
Registers up to ten new controls whose state can be moved up and down with two switches.<br>
Example: The flaps slowly move up as long as the up-switch is triggered and move down if the down-switch is triggered.<br>
The input switches can also be proportional which allows even more precise controls.<br>
<br>
Combined with a virtual sensors this can also act as an integral over any control or telemetry.<br></p>
<h3>Neutral point</h3>
<p>
Describes the input value for which the output does not change. Usually it is -1, but can be 0 if one switch is used to control both directions.
When the neutral point is 0, both inputs can control both directions. Hence it is useful when the input(s) should be integrated.
</p>
<h3>Delay</h3>
<p>
The time it takes the output value to change by 1. Defines the movement speed.
