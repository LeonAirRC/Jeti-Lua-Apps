  <h3>Selection dialog</h3>

The selection dialog shows a list of all batteries. For every type of battery (denoted by the title) you can click on one battery and the dialog moves on to the next type.
  <ul>
    <li><b>+/-:</b> the cycle count of the focused battery can be modified manually, for example after an unintended selection</li>
    <li><b>F3/F4:</b> go to the previous type/skip current type without any cycle increase</li>
    <li><b>F5/Enter:</b> increases the cycle count of the focused battery by one and moves on to the next type</li>
  </ul>
